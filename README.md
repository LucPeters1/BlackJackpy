# Simple Blackjack Game

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game written in Python. The user can choose the number of decks and the number of rounds to play. The game follows basic blackjack rules and provides an easy-to-understand interface for the user.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game is stored.
4. Run the game by typing `python blackjack.py` and pressing Enter.

## Rules

The game follows basic blackjack rules:
- The objective is to get a hand with a higher point value than the dealer without going over 21.
- Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10, and Aces are worth 11 or 1, whichever is more beneficial.
- The player and dealer are each dealt two cards initially.
- The player can choose to "hit" (draw an additional card) or "stand" (end their turn).
- The dealer will draw cards until they have at least 17 points.
- If the player or dealer goes over 21 points, they lose the round.
- If both the player and dealer have the same point value, it's a tie.

Please note that this implementation is simplified and does not cover all blackjack rules or edge cases, but it serves as a good starting point for a simple game.
